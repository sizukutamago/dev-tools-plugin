# TDD Integration Testing

Enforce strict Test-Driven Development using the Red-Green-Refactor cycle with dedicated subagents.

## Mandatory Workflow

Every new feature MUST follow this strict 3-phase cycle. Do NOT skip phases.

### Phase 1: RED - Write Failing Test

🔴 RED PHASE: Delegating to tdd-test-writer...

Invoke the `tdd-test-writer` subagent with:
- Feature requirement from user request
- Expected behavior to test

The subagent returns:
- Test file path
- Failure output confirming test fails
- Summary of what the test verifies

**Do NOT proceed to Green phase until test failure is confirmed.**

### Phase 2: GREEN - Make It Pass

🟢 GREEN PHASE: Delegating to tdd-implementer...

Invoke the `tdd-implementer` subagent with:
- Test file path from RED phase
- Feature requirement context

The subagent returns:
- Files modified
- Success output confirming test passes
- Implementation summary

**Do NOT proceed to Refactor phase until test passes.**

### Phase 3: REFACTOR - Improve

🔵 REFACTOR PHASE: Delegating to tdd-refactorer...

Invoke the `tdd-refactorer` subagent with:
- Test file path
- Implementation files from GREEN phase

The subagent returns either:
- Changes made + test success output, OR
- "No refactoring needed" with reasoning

**Cycle complete when refactor phase returns.**

## Multiple Features

Complete the full cycle for EACH feature before starting the next:

Feature 1: 🔴 → 🟢 → 🔵 ✓
Feature 2: 🔴 → 🟢 → 🔵 ✓
Feature 3: 🔴 → 🟢 → 🔵 ✓

## Phase Violations

Never:
- Write implementation before the test
- Proceed to Green without seeing Red fail
- Skip Refactor evaluation
- Start a new feature before completing the current cycle
